# PHP-CRUD


Hello, this is our Library Management System. 

This works by using XAMPP. 

Upon using a browser, simply open the localhost while the files of this repository is inside xampp, select the index.php, it will open a website. (Yes, we got the source code for this front page and template online, but the whole thing and the database was hardcoded.)
